Slackyard Softball is a softball team management game. Users start a team and create players, then put those players into lineups (your most recent active lineup will play games). Overnight each league will play a season. The regular season consists of two round robins of three-game series. The playoffs are a five-game series tournament among the top four teams in the regular season. Each game is simulated pitch-by-pitch based on player statistics and manipulations of [Bill James' Log5 equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log5).
